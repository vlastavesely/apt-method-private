APT Helper for Encrypted Repositories
=====================================
This is a helper method for the APT packaging tool that allows users to fetch
packages from encrypted remote repositories. The idea behind this helper method
is to combine the comfort of working with online APT repositories and the
security of packages and scripts that are strictly kept offline and not freely
accessible in the Internet.


Design
------
A public APT repository is a directory tree with a distinctive structure
containing DEB packages. In the standard scenario, the tree is published as it
is on the Internet and users can freely download the packages. This package
allows you to (1) encrypt your private APT repository and (2) hide its
directory structure at the same time.

This package contains two programs: the encoder ‘apt-private-prepare’, and
the APT transport method ‘private’.

The first program is used to encrypt your APT repository using the following
process:

  (1) a list of files in the source directory is created,

  (2) for every file, a unique file name is generated using a random salt
      (optional) and the relative path of the file (starting with a slash) in
      the source directory, and

  (3) the content of every file is encrypted and saved into the destination
      directory under the generated name corresponding to the file.

The whole structure of the source repository will be reduced to a flat
directory that contains all files in one level. The result can be safely
published on a remote server.

If you configure your APT installation properly, it will be able to fetch
packages from such a repository using the ‘private’ method helper, without
a need for interaction with the user.

For details on setup and information about the implementation details see the
included manual pages.
